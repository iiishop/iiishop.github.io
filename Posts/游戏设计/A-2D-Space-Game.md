# Introduction
These days, I have forgotten when I first clicked the Star Citizen video, but I must admit that it is the most wonderful space-similar game. This might not just be a game but also a second life for us. From every detail of the performance, you can feel that the characters seem to live in the real world. This fascinates me and drives me to want to touch more and more of this world. However, you know, as a game, Star Citizen has not finished its ambition, and I don't want to wait. So, also, as a game designer, I decided to make our own space-similar game.
